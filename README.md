Operating systems (OS) can be categorized based on various criteria, such as functionality, the type of devices they support, and their licensing models. Here are some common types:

1. **Batch Operating System**: Executes jobs in batches without user interaction. Example: Early IBM systems.
   
2. **Time-Sharing Operating System**: Allows multiple users to use the system simultaneously by sharing time slices. Example: Unix.

3. **Distributed Operating System**: Manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer. Example: Amoeba.

4. **Network Operating System**: Provides services to computers connected to a network. Example: Windows Server, Novell NetWare.

5. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**: Provides immediate processing and response to input. Example: VxWorks, QNX.

6. **Mobile Operating System**: Designed for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Example: Android, iOS.

7. **Desktop Operating System**: Intended for use on personal computers and workstations. Example: Windows, macOS, Linux.

8. **Embedded Operating System**: Used for specialized devices where the OS is embedded as part of the device. Example: Embedded Linux, FreeRTOS.

9. **Cloud Operating System**: Manages cloud computing infrastructure and services. Example: OpenStack, AWS.

10. **Free and Open-Source Operating System**: Source code is freely available for modification and distribution. Example: Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora).

11. **Proprietary Operating System**: Developed and owned by a specific company, with restricted access to the source code. Example: Windows, macOS.
